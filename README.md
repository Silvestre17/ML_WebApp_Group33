### WebApp Overview

The app is divided into 2 sections:

1. **Model Prediction**: Prediction of the New York Workers' Compensation Board's decision on injury claims based on the input data provided by the user.
2. **Data Exploration**: Analysis of the dataset used to train the model. The user can explore the dataset and understand the relationships between the features and the target variable.

#### Dashboard Setup Locally

To run the dashboard, please follow the steps below:

1. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. `\cd` into the directory where the file `mlproject_group33_streamlit.py` is located.

3. Run the following command:

```bash
streamlit run mlproject_group33_streamlit.py
```

4. Access the dashboard through the link provided in the terminal.
5. Enjoy! ðŸš€ðŸ”Ž
